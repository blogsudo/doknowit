<p><span class="font2">Retirado do livro “The Bonsai Handbook“ de Colin Lewis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ISBN 1-903938-30-9</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MOYOGI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-1.jpg" style="width:282pt;height:381pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">This is a variation on the formal upright style but is much easier to create.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The rules for the branch structure are the same but the trunk may have any number of curves, both from left to right and from&nbsp;front to back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The branches should ideally grow from the outside of the curves and never on the inside as this creates a shock to the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The apex should lean towards the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The tree illustrated is just one of the many variations on the informal upright style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unlike the Formal Upright, Moyogi works equally as well with deciduous and coniferous species.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHOKKAN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Formal Upright</span></p><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-2.jpg" style="width:152pt;height:318pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">As the name implies, this is the most formalised of all styles. The trunk must be ramrod straight and bolt upright, tapering&nbsp;uniformly from base to tip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The branches should be arranged alternately either side of the trunk with every third branch to the rear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The branches should diminish in thickness and in length from the lowest one upwards, and should be either horizontal or&nbsp;sloping downwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ideally, the spaces between the branches should also diminish toward the top of the tree, in proportion to their thickness and&nbsp;length.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SHAKAN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">Slanting</span></p><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-3.jpg" style="width:200pt;height:265pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Another variation on the formal upright style, except that it is not upright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trunk is usually straight-ish, although it may have a gentle curve or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The placement of the branches needs to be carefully thought out in order to stabilise the design and to prevent the tree looking as&nbsp;if it is about to fall over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unlike the previous two styles, the number and placement of the branches is less crucial, providing the opportunity for creativity.&nbsp;For instance, using only the top branches and training them down&nbsp;steeply can result in a dramatic image.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FUKINAGASHI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-4.jpg" style="width:308pt;height:390pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Although this is one of the more naturalistic styles, it is also one of the most dramatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The aim is to capture the dynamic shape and movement of a tree living high in the mountains or on a clifftop, where it is&nbsp;constantly exposed to high prevailing winds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are no rules governing the trunk shape or location of branches, but in spite of this freedom this is one of the most&nbsp;difficult styles to create successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The difficulty lies in making the image appear authentic, rather than merely looking like a tree with branches on one side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trick is to ensure that the windswept effect begins at the base of the trunk and is reflected in every aspect of the tree.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HAN-KENGAI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-5.jpg" style="width:306pt;height:362pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Both this style and the cascade style depict trees clinging to a cliff face, where they are beaten by snow, wind and rockfalls.&nbsp;The trunk should have dramatic curves and taper, and the branches&nbsp;should ideally also cascade from the trunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tradition states that the inverted ‘apex’ should be positioned directly below the base of the trunk when the tree is viewed&nbsp;from the ‘front’, but this can inhibit the design somewhat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These days it’s perfectly acceptable to allow the lowest point of the tree to be placed to one side of the pot, as if it was reaching&nbsp;out from a cliff face to find light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The one unbreakable rule is that the lowest point must be below the rim of the pot, but not its base.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KENGAI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-6.jpg" style="width:253pt;height:386pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">The difference between this style and the semi-cascade is that here the trunk must fall below the base of the pot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All other criteria are the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Good cascades are rare because of the difficulty in maintaining vigour in the lower parts of the tree, opposing its natural urge&nbsp;to grow upwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is probably the most difficult of all styles to design convincingly, partly because of the horticultural problem, but&nbsp;mainly because we have few natural examples to recall as&nbsp;inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is important to include dramatic features and sharp angles to evoke the feeling of a tree clinging to life in the harsh mountain&nbsp;conditions.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARIMIKI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-7.jpg" style="width:210pt;height:367pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Echoing the natural appearance of mountain junipers, which produce areas of bare, sun-bleached wood as they age, this style&nbsp;is seldom successfully created from other species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The focal point is the beautiful and dramatic shapes of the grain in the exposed wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These shapes may be natural but are more often elaborately carved and then bleached and preserved with lime-sulphur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The foliage masses, although acknowledging some of the rules of other styles, serve more as a foil or frame to the driftwood.&nbsp;This style is suitable for conifers and rarely, if ever, applied to&nbsp;deciduous species of bonsai tree.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOKIDACHI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-8.jpg" style="width:230pt;height:359pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">This style was modelled on the natural habit of the zelkova and is seldom successfully used for other than related species, since&nbsp;it works best with trees bearing alternate foliage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All branches should emerge from the top of a straight trunk and fork at regularly diminishing internals until a network of fine&nbsp;shoots at the tips forms an even-domed crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For broom styles to work well, they must be perfectly symmetrical and meticulously trained and pruned to ensure an even and&nbsp;gradual transition from trunk, through heavy branches, to the&nbsp;finest terminal shoots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Trying to rush the development will always end in disappointment.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BUNJINGI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-9.jpg" style="width:192pt;height:363pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">This style is reminiscent of ancient pines, which tend to shed their lower branches as they get old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It gets its name from the calligraphic style of ancient Chinese artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The focal point of the design is the trunk, so it should be full of character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The branches are limited to the uppermost part of the trunk and should bear just enough foliage to keep the tree healthy and&nbsp;vigorous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The foliage should, however, be immaculately positioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pots used for literati styles are generally round and comparatively small to balance the sparse foliage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They are also frequently’rustic’ in appearance, to reflect the tree’s rocky habitat.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SEKIJOJU</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-10.jpg" style="width:215pt;height:364pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">In rocky terrain the scarce soil is constantly being eroded, exposing the rocks and the roots of the trees growing amongst&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This style depicts such a tree whose roots, as they thicken, cling to any rocks beneath them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The tree itself can be of any style, although broom and formal upright styles look out of place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most important factor is that the roots should cling tightly to the rock and should have a mature texture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This can take many years to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First, the root-covered rock must first be planted in the ground for several seasons to consolidate, and then exposed to the air&nbsp;and sun for the bark to develop mature characteristics.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ISHITSUKI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-11.jpg" style="width:214pt;height:362pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">The tree itself may follow any style, the significance is that a rock is used instead of a pot, with the roots growing in a crevice&nbsp;or hollow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The rock may stand in a shallow dish of soil or, better still, in a water tray Mixed plantings of pines with red maples or dwarf&nbsp;quince and azalea are particularly successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The essence of the root on rock style is the natural landscape that the composition evokes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The choice of rocks, tree species and various accompanying plants must be carefully made, ensuring that they all harmonise visually&nbsp;and horticulturally, since repotting can be a difficult operation.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NETSUNANARI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-12.jpg" style="width:261pt;height:368pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">As the name suggests, this is a raft planting where the original horizontal trunk has attractive snake-like curves and is exposed&nbsp;in such a way as to show this feature to its best advantage.&nbsp;With a style like this it is even acceptable for the old trunk to be&nbsp;above the ground in places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The natural inspiration for the sinuous raft style is a fallen tree that has sprouted vertical branches and then taken root in places&nbsp;where it has come into contact with the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although trees of this kind themselves may conform to any style, they should harmonise and all be similar in trunk movement.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IKADABUKI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-13.jpg" style="width:246pt;height:361pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Another obvious one: a raft planting where the original trunk lies in a straight line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most rafts created from nursery stock follow this style because of the difficulty of bending a fairly thick trunk into sinuous curves.In&nbsp;such cases the trunk is usually buried in the soil or covered with&nbsp;moss to disguise its unnatural appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The main problem to solve when making a straight raft is how to avoid a straight row of trunks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This can be achieved by training some branches horizontally forward or backward before bending them up to form trunks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is even possible to create a fairly dense forest in this way.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEAGARI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-14.jpg" style="width:353pt;height:361pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Most of us have driven down lanes where the steep banks have been washed away to expose the roots of an ancient beech or&nbsp;pine, and this style is based on such cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The roots, which must have mature bark and interesting shapes, add a dramatic, rugged appearance, so the design of the tree&nbsp;itself should echo this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The foliage mass should be kept fairly small so that its weight or wind resistance doesn’t cause the exposed roots to bend over.&nbsp;You might find wild specimens that lend themselves to training&nbsp;in this style, but more often than not, growing from scratch is&nbsp;the easiest method.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SOJU</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-15.jpg" style="width:202pt;height:365pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Two trunks, one smaller than the other, joined together at the base.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Trunks which divide significantly above the base are unacceptable. The smaller or secondary trunk should be slightly to the rear of&nbsp;the dominant one to enhance the perspective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trees themselves may follow any appropriate style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These bonsai can sometimes be difficult to maintain in the long term, because as the trunks thicken with age, the fork between&nbsp;them inevitably begins to fill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This has the effect of raising the junction until eventually it is too high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When starting a soju, make the angle between the trunks as wide as possible.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BANKAN</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-16.jpg" style="width:220pt;height:365pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">This most unnatural of all bonsai styles has heavy Chinese influence. It became popular for a time last century and was&nbsp;grown in large numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although still popular among some hobbyists, it is seldom accepted in classic circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trunk spirals from base to apex while the branch structure follows that of the informal upright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unfortunately, the majority of commercial, mass-produced small bonsai - intended for the gift market - are bad examples of this&nbsp;style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Far Eastern growers seem to think that this is what Westerners believe a tree looks like!</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KABUDACHI</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-17.jpg" style="width:206pt;height:356pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Any (odd) number of trunks, which must be in a variety of sizes, all growing on the same roots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This may either be created from suckers (shoots arising naturally from the roots) or by cutting off a thick trunk at the base and&nbsp;using the new shoots which spring up from the stump.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trees can be any style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The horticultural advantage of using a clump rather than separate plants is that the ‘trees’ do not compete for water and nutrients.&nbsp;As with the raft and group styles, the trunks should have similar&nbsp;movement and characteristics but must also vary in thickness.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">YOSE-UE</span></h1><img src="Bonsai Styles_files/Bonsai Styles-18.jpg" style="width:253pt;height:364pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">This style may incorporate any number of trunks from seven up to as many as you like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The main interest is in the interplay between the trunks, which should be of different sizes and should be arranged to give the&nbsp;impression of depth and perspective. No three trunks should&nbsp;form a straight line and no trunk should be obscured by another&nbsp;when viewed from the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trees in the centre of the group or forest should be the tallest, with the thickest trunks bearing the most foliage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trunks on the perimeter should lean outward, reaching for the light.</span></p>
